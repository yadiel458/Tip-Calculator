## Notes
This Pre-Work was a real challenge for me, currently im in first year of college and Im taking basic curses this semester that means that I don’t have previous experience with coding in swift. I had to do a lot of research on the web about XCode and I learn a lot of this programming language. At first it was easy to me designing the ViewController and I finish it quickly, but I thought that was all then I came back to the Pre-Work page and I saw that I had to add a settings view. Coding that Settings View was the hardest part of making this app, it takes me most of the time I spend making this tip calculator.
